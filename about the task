# Braille Autocorrect

Braille Autocorrect is a simple and efficient tool designed to assist users who input Braille using a
standard QWERTY keyboard. It helps identify and suggest the most likely intended word from a
predefined dictionary, even if there are minor typing errors or mismatches in the Braille input.

- Accurately suggests the intended word based on Braille input-even when there are small mistakes.
- Uses specific QWERTY keys (D, W, Q, K, O, P) to represent Braille dot positions.
- Developed with a simple, beginner-friendly approach-no advanced algorithms required.
- Lightweight and fast, written in C++ for optimal performance.

# How It Works

Users enter Braille characters by pressing specific QWERTY keys that correspond to Braille dot
positions. Each letter is separated by a pipe (|). For instance, the input:
D K|D|D O K
represents the word "cat" in Braille.
The program reads this input, converts it into Braille dot patterns, and compares it with a list of valid
words. It then calculates the difference between the input and each dictionary word, and suggests
the closest match. This is especially useful for visually impaired users to reduce input mistakes and
receive helpful suggestions.

# How to Use

1. Compile the program using:

g++ braille-autocorrect.cpp -o braille-autocorrect

2. Run the executable:

./braille-autocorrect

3. Enter your Braille input when prompted.

Example:
Input: D K|D|D O
Output: Did you mean: cat?
